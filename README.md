# up221-nasir
Hi, my name is Nasir a first year MURP student at UCLA. I am enrolled in UP 221 at UCLA, the class is centered on the foundations of spatial science. I am looking forward to continuing to build my technical capabilties. Here at UCLA, I am interested in extreme heat events in transportation systems.
